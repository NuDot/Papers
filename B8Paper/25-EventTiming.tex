\subsection{0\nbb-decay signal and 2\nbb-decay background}

In both 0\nbb-decay signal and 2\nbb-decay background events near the decay energy spectrum endpoint, the kinematics of the
electron pair is very similar. Large fraction of events have a nearly back-to-back topology with a close to 
equal energy split between electrons. To simulate 0\nbb- and 2\nbb-decay events we use a Monte Carlo generator based on phase 
factors from Ref.~\cite{Jenni}. Similarity in kinematics of 0\nbb- and 2\nbb-decay events is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Kinematics}.

The electron angular correlations for 0\nbb-decay are noticeably different from 2\nbb-decay due to a contribution from the
neutrino wave-functions even at vanishingly small energies of the neutrinos~\cite{Jenni}. However, any practical use of this difference 
in separating 0\nbb-decay from 2\nbb-decay would require extremely large number of candidate events. Given the half-time of 2\nbb-decay 
and upper limits on the half-time of 0\nbb-decay, electron angular correlations will not bring a decisive separation power in controlling 
2\nbb-decay background in currently planned 0\nbb-decay experiments. Excellent energy resolution at the Q-value remains the key parameter
in 2\nbb~background suppression.

While we do not exclude that the angular correlations as an input to a multivariative technique may improve sensitivity of 0\nbb-decay 
searches, in this paper we assume that there is no difference in the event topology between 0\nbb-~and 2\nbb-decay events. Any conclusions 
about 0\nbb-decay events also hold for 2\nbb-decay when the total energy of the electrons in 2\nbb-decay events is close to the Q-value.

Examining the kinematics for one of the 0\nbb~electrons with equal energy split, a 1.26~MeV electron travels a total path length of 
7.1$\pm$0.9~mm, 
has a distance from the origin of 5.6$\pm$1.0~mm in 26.2$\pm$3.4~ps  and takes 23.5$\pm$3.2~ps to drop below Cherenkov threshold. 
We note that due to scattering of the electron, the final direction of the electron before it stops does not correspond to the initial 
direction; however the scattering angle is small at the time the majority of Cherenkov light is produced.

Figure~\ref{fig:ArrivalTimeDist} shows the output of the detector simulation for 1000 simulated \Te~ 0\nbb-decay 
events. The left-hand panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:ArrivalTimeDist} compares PE arrival time between Cherenkov and scintillation light.
The right-hand panel shows the composition of the early PE sample, which is key to direction and topographical reconstruction, 
selected with the time cut of 33.5~ns. On average each \Te~ 0\nbb-decay produces total of 62.8$\pm$0.3 PEs in the early PE sample. 
Event-by-event fluctuations on the total number of PEs in the early sample have the root mean squre (RMS) of 8.9 PEs. 
On average the early PE sample consist of 28.6$\pm$0.2 scintillation and 34.2$\pm$0.2 Cherenkov PEs, where event-by-event fluctuations have
the RMS of 5.2 and 7.3 repectively.

\end{figure*}


Selection of PEs with relatively small arrival time allows the selection of a sample of PEs with a high fraction of directional Cherenkov light.
This allows for event topology reconstruction. In particular, signal-like events with exactly two electrons can be separated from events 
with only one electron such as from \B~solar neutrino interactions.


\subsection{\B~background}

For a detector similar to our model, \B~background is significant due to large total mass of the liquid scintillator in
the active region of the detector.
Electrons from elastic scattering of \B~solar neutrinos have nearly a flat energy spectrum around the 
Q-value~\cite{SNOp-B8-bkg}. We simulate \B~background as a single monochromatic electron with energy of 2.53~MeV 
(Q-value of \Te). A 2.53~MeV electron travels a total path length of 15.5$\pm$2.0~mm, has a distance from the origin of 12.6$\pm$2.2~mm in 
54.9$\pm$6.9~ps and takes 49.3$\pm$1.3~ps to drop below Cherenkov threshold.

The shape of scintillation and Cherenkov PE timing distributions in \B~events match very closely the shape of corresponding distributions
for 0\nbb-decay events shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ArrivalTimeDist}. The electron path length is too short compared to the detector size to 
introduce any noticable difference in the shape of PE timing distributions between a single electron from \B~events and two 
electrons from 0\nbb-events.


On average each \B~event produces total of 69.9$\pm$0.3 PEs in the early PE sample.
Event-by-event fluctuations on the total number of PEs in the early sample have the RMS of 9.7 PEs.
On average the early PE sample consist of 27.6$\pm$0.2 scintillation and 42.3$\pm$0.3 Cherenkov PEs, where event-by-event fluctuations have
the RMS of 5.2 and 8.2 repectively.

The total energy depositited in the detector in \B~and 0\nbb-decay events is the same. This leads to nearly the same amount of 
scintillation light produced in the detector. 

The number of Cherenkov photons is $\sim$10\% higher for \B~events compared to 0\nbb-decay events. This is because Cherenkov 
light in \B~events is being produced by a single electron, while the same kinetic energy is split between two electrons 
in 0\nbb-decay events. 

We do note use small difference in the total number of PEs in the early PE sample due to Cherenkov PE contribution 
to separate 0\nbb-decay signal from \B~background However, it may provide an extra handle on signal-background separation in a 
multivariative analysis when combined with directional and topographical information.
