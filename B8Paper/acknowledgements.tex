We thank G. Orebi Gann of UC for a discussion on expected backgrounds
at the SNO+ experiment, and J.  Kotilla for discussions on electron
angular correlations in 0\nbb-decay and for providing data with phase
factors for generating 0\nbb- and 2\nbb-decay events.  We are grateful
to C. Aberle for initial development of the Geant-4
detector model used in this paper and for contributions to the
development of the Cherenkov/scintillation light separation technique, and
to M.  Wetstein for help with vertex reconstruction algorithms and
productive discussions on Cherenkov/scintillation light separation. We
thank E. Spieglan for productive discussions on spherical harmonics
analysis and E. Angelico for estimating the effects of photo-detector
position and time resolution on the vertex reconstruction and
verifying the effects of chromatic dispersion.  We thank J. Flusser
for helpful discussions on image processing using moment
invariants. Last but not least we thank M. Yeh for discussions of the
timing properties of liquid scintillators.
