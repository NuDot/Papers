\section{Conclusions}
A technique based on spherical harmonics analysis can
separate 0{\nbb} decay from $^{8}$B solar neutrino interactions. The
separation is based on the distinct event topologies of signal and
background. This event topology information is available in addition
to the measurements of the energy deposited in the detector. This
technique may be further developed and adopted by future large scale
liquid scintillator detectors to suppress background coming from
$^{8}$B solar neutrino interactions in the detector volume. The
performance of the technique is mostly affected by chromatic
dispersion, vertex reconstruction and the time profile of the emission of scintillation light. We show that a liquid scintillator detector
with a scintillation rise time constant $\tau_r=$5~ns provide sufficient cherenkov-scintillation light separation and potentially allows
for use of the spherical harmonics analysis
as an extra handle to extract 0{\nbb} decay signal.
