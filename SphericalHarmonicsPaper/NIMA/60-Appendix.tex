\section{0{\nbb} decay vs $^{10}$C background}

Other common backgrounds to 0{\nbb} decay search include radioactive
decays of nuclei that are excited by cosmic muons and produced through the decays of Th and U
naturally present in the materials. In liquid scintillator detectors,
most of events from Th and U decays occur in the materials of
the scintillator enclosure. Typically, they enter the fiducial volume
as 2.6~MeV gammas. These gammas pass into the fiducial volume either because they showered too late or have
mis-reconstructed vertex. Both effects depend on details of a
particular experiment and in this paper we make no attempt
to introduce a topology reconstruction for the backgrounds coming from
Th and U lines. Cosmic induced backgrounds, to the contrary, are more
generic and originate inside the fiducial volume. In this section we
discuss event topology of $^{10}$C events that are most relevant in the
energy of 2-3~MeV.

Typical energy deposition by $^{10}$C events is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Edep_C10}. We propose to use spherical harmonics
analysis to separate 0{\nbb} decay events from $^{10}$C events that
within energy resolution overlap with the 0{\nbb} decay Q-value.

We note that 98\% of $^{10}$C decays through the excited state of
$^{10}$B(718), which has a half-life time of $\sim$1~ns. Therefore, the
majority of $^{10}$C events have a prompt positron accompanied by a
delayed 0.718~MeV gamma. This delayed gamma affects the PE arrival time
distribution. Figure~\ref{fig:Arrival_time_C10} compares the shape of the
PE arrival time distribution between $^{130}$Te 0{\nbb} decays and
$^{10}$C events. The time profile of the scintillation photons can be used
to separate signal from $^{10}$C events.

Comparison of spherical harmonics is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:SL_C10_33p5ns_center}. $^{10}$C events are generated at
the center of the detector. True vertex position is used to apply a
33.5~ns time cut to select photons for the spherical harmonics
analysis. The separation is seen in S0 vs S1 and S2 vs S3 scatter
plots. We project both scatter plots to a line that gives maximum
separation (two bottom panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:SL_C10_33p5ns_center}).  
There is enough separation between the distributions to suggest that this analysis can be used to distinguish between 0{\nbb} and $^{10}$C events.
