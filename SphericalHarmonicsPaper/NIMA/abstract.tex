We propose a technique for separating 0{\nbb}-decay events from
background due to $^{10}$C decays and $^8$B solar neutrino
interactions in a liquid scintillator detector. These represent the
key backgrounds at shallow and deep sites. The technique compares
event topology of the signal and background events using spherical
harmonics analysis of the early light emitted in 0{\nbb}-decay and
$^8$B events. Selection of early photons using fast photo-detectors
allows for separation of directional Cherenkov from isotropic
scintillation light and identification of two event topologies based
on the spatial distribution of the early photons in the detector.
