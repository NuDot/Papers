\section{Conclusions}
A technique based on spherical harmonics analysis is discussed to
separate 0{\nbb} decay from $^{8}$B solar neutrino interactions. The
separation is based on distinct event topologies of signal and
background. This event topology information is available in addition
to the measurements of the energy deposited in the detector. This
technique may be further developed and adopted by future large scale
liquid scintillator detectors to suppress background coming from
$^{8}$B solar neutrino interactions in the detector volume. The
performance of the technique is mostly affected by chromatic
dispersions, vertex reconstruction and time profile of the emission of
the scintillation light. We show that a liquid scintillator detector
with a $\sim$1~ns total delay of the scintillation light with respect
to the Cherenkov light allows for use of spherical harmonics analysis
as an extra handle to extract 0{\nbb} decay signal.
